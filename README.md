# Leap Year Tracker 

The Leap Year Tracker is a simple yet effective tool designed to identify and track leap years. This project provides a Python-based solution to determine whether a given year is a leap year, along with additional features for tracking leap years within a specified range.

### Project Description
Leap years are unique because they contain an extra day—February 29th—which is added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year. The Leap Year Tracker allows users to easily check if a particular year is a leap year and provides a way to list all leap years within a given range.

### Objectives:
* Determine if a specific year is a leap year.
* List all leap years within a specified range.
* Provide an easy-to-use interface for tracking leap years.

### Features
* ****Leap Year Identification:**** Quickly determine if a single year is a leap year.
* ****Range Tracking:**** Track all leap years within a user-defined range of years.
* ****Simple Interface:**** A clean and straightforward Python script with easy-to-understand logic.

### Technologies Used
* ****Python:**** Core programming language used for the project.
* ****Jupyter Notebook:**** For running and testing the script in an interactive environment.
